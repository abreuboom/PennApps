## signAR - _ASL Translator and Learning Tool_

# Inspiration
The idea from this project came about from a very simple question that we could not think of an answer for: why doesn't Google Translate work for sign language? There are estimated to be [around 70 million deaf people in the world](https://wfdeaf.org/faq/) yet the biggest tool for translation doesn't target this demographic. We felt that translation is not only a means of communication between speakers of different languages, but also a way for people to share their cultural background. As such, we decided to tackle the problem of creating a translation engine that could convert ASL (American Sign Language) to English.
